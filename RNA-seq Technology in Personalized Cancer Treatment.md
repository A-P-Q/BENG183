# RNA-Seq Technology in Personalized Cancer Treatment
By Shirley Xie, Charles Choi, Jiachen Xu

## Introduction

### Personalized Cancer treatment
Personalized cancer treatment, often referred to as precision medicine or personalized medicine, involves tailoring medical care to the individual characteristics of each patient and their specific type of cancer. This approach aims to optimize treatment effectiveness while minimizing side effects by considering factors such as genetic makeup, molecular profiles of tumors, lifestyle, and other individual factors.

Genetic testing helps identify specific mutations or alterations within a patient's cancer cells. This information can guide treatment decisions, including targeted therapies that address the unique genetic features of the tumor.

### RNA-seq
RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing) is a powerful and widely used technique in molecular biology and genomics. It's a method used to analyze the presence and quantity of RNA in a biological sample, providing valuable insights into gene expression, alternative splicing, and transcriptomic changes within cells or tissues.

### Differential Expression analysis
Differential Expression analysis is a fundamental method used in genomics and transcriptomics to compare gene expression levels between different conditions or groups, such as healthy vs. diseased samples, treated vs. untreated samples, or different developmental stages.
