This markdown and be viewed in github with html render effect: 
https://github.com/Irenexzwen/3D-genome-gitbook/blob/master/chap2/c-techs-chromosome-conformation-capture-coupled.md

Basic markdown syntax will help you understand how to organise the formats (google it!).
Besides, github can also render html syntax (in template.md, table and anchor settings are all html syntax, you're welcomed to use them for better presentation :D)
